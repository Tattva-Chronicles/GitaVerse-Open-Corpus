# HF3 Original Dataset (Same as GH1)

This dataset contains:

- Chapter metadata
- Verse texts
- Multi-language translations
- Detailed commentaries by multiple spiritual authors

We have used the HuggingFace Link for our creation but we found it to be the same for this repo and hence mentioned both.
